Religion is a very sensitive and controversial topic to talk about, especially coming from a country which has a very conservative approach to religion it is hard to talk about this topic openly.

I am a firm beleiver of Islam, although I do not pray daily I still practice most of the things taught in Islam, for example I abstain from alcohol, pork and some other things not allowed in Islam. In my opinion, Islam is not as strict as the Pakistani soceity has made it. 

I won't classify myself too knowledgeable about religions, I have not put much research in them. In the future I do plan to study religions more closely but as of now it is something I might not take up mainly because it just doesn't interest me that much. Ofcourse, according to some people this might be a bad thing but ofcourse it is something which I think as of now. For sure, one day I plan onto read Quran, Bible and other religious books just to see what they have to say.

In the end everybody is free to choose his/her own religion and people should not be forced to beleive in something just because you beleive in one thing. 

I also think that religion is one of the important aspect of life as it puts a moral bounds on people and helps them to be a better person. Furthermore, religion also answers one of the things I have struggled with a lot: Nihilism. To a lot of people religion gives purpose to life and satisfies the need for meaning. For me, unfortunately that is not the case, for now nothing gives me purpose and I am still struggling with nihilism. 

I do keep myself busy with work and video games but sometimes it still feels like I might be missing something. I truly thank Allah because there is no way without Him I would be where I am today, there have been a lot of times I can not explain logically but it was truly meant by Allah for me to be where I am today. Maybe one day I turn to religion and change but for now I am still trying to find myself. :)
