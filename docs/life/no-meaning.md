# No meaning

Recently a thought which I used to negate mostly has taken a repititive cycle: nihilism.
I studied Nihilism in January 2021 when I was mentally at a very bad spot, I didn't talk to anyone and the pandemic made everything worse. To make things worse I was not satisfied with my performance in university and things weren't the best. At that moment I had dreams and ambitions, I wanted to travel to various places and that kept me going.

Recently I have no idea but I started to think of life as not worth living, maybe that is due to the fact my overview of life is through a very limited keyhole that is I think of life as follows: being born, working all your life and then dying.

I do realize that I am negating all the beautiful experiences people have in life, finding love, experiencing the joy of travelling or trying amazing foods, having children or pets and giving them love, meeting new people etc. But I still do think that the face that life is overall very hard (at least in 3rd world countries) it outweighs the little amount of good experiences we have. Maybe one day my point of view might change but as of Jan, 2023 I am struggling to find a reason to live.
