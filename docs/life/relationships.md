I am not in a very experienced or someone who can say much about this but still I think writing some things can be beneficial on this topic. I don't consider myself the best of friend or the best communicator and one of the reason is that I need to reach some level of comfort with a person before speaking myself out. 

### Friendship
I do have had deep levels and shallow level of friendships with people in my life. I have had friends who I have known for a long time and I have had friends who I have known for a short time. I have had friends who I have known for a long time but I don't talk to them anymore and I have had friends who I have known for a short time but I don't talk to them anymore.

I think this is the almost the case with everyone, I do beleive that as a friend you should support your friends, not take advantage of them, not be a toxic person and not be a person who is not loyal. I think these are the basic things which a friend should be. The thing is you never know what might the real intentions of other person be so you should spend some time with them and see how they are. 

Good things take time, you can't just call someone your friend you met for a day or two. Ofcourse they might be a friend (shallow level) but for me I won't call them my real friends. Sadly as you get older its very hard to make friends so do cherish the friendships and try not to lose contact with them. 

People change over time, its wise not to expect your friend to be the same after all the time you spent together. Friends are a vital part to our mental health and some friendships are really amazing and help you grow as a person. In adult life, contacts do matter a lot and you never know your friends might help you one day.

Be a good friend, be loyal, be supportive, be a good listener, be a good communicator, be a good person. Always be kind to people and even if you are did bad to someone, try to make it up to them. 

### Romantic Relationships
Nothing to say here bro just move on XD. 

I just have had crushes which never amounted to anything and I don't think so anybody had a serious crush on me. :P
