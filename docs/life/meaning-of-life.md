# Meaning of Life
Isn't everybody trying to find answer to this question? When we grow up, I think most people ask the question to this to themselves. Is the meaning of life going to school, studying then getting a job and then dying? Is that all there is to life? 

Most people find meaning in relationships, religion, work. Ofcourse it varies from person to person, to some people relationships are the most important thing and they derieve a lot of meaning from it while to others religion comes first and similarly some people find meaning in work. But even if you find meaining in something does that mean you have found the meaning of life?

Religion does answer this question in a way, it says that the meaning of life is to worship God and to prepare for the afterlife thus this eliminates the possibility of Nihilism. 

For now, I haven't actually found the meaning of life. I am just passing time in work, video games and internet surfing. I do have thought about this question a lot and fell into the Nihilistic thought process. As of now I think there really isn't any meaning to life and we just are here to pass time and die. But ofcourse this thought process negates religion in every way, and I do not present it as a counter argument to that in any way. I just know that there is some meaning to life but as of now I have not found it.
