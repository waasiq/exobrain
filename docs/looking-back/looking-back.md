# Looking Back

I have liked to track the things since I was a child, mentally I used to revisit the previous month and assess whether I had been productive or what kind of events had happened. Usually in those years, time relatively felt passing slowly instead of real fast. I can't actually grasp how fast time is passing by, a year literally feels like nothing. I do not have an idea to why the time is passing by so fast, interesting things do happen now and then but usually mostly the routine is repetitive. 

I would say that due to being busy mostly or indulging in activities time tends to go really fast, but again it's just scary that it's 2023 now, 2016 just feels like yesterday. 

The fondest memories that I have over my life are as followings:
1. Playing cricket with childhood friends in Askari 6.
2. Playing bugs life and badminton with Hamza Asif (childhood friend) in 2007.
3. Delivering speech in front of 500 people in CCH.
4. Getting on the plane for Turkey for first time and feeling the happiness in Istanbul.
5. Going around and playing dangerous dave with Heera mamoo.
6. Playing GTA SA and cricket in Adil's home.
7. Going to Jummah prayer in Askari 7 with Dadda abbu (I used to think it was boring but it is a very fond memory now).
8. Starting cricket team in Chaklala Garrison and playing cricket together.
9. Playing games with Hasnain in office.
10. Screaming in class in 10th grade when teacher went out to have fun.
11. B2 level of Tomer.
12. Going to Aushwitcz as I wanted to see that place a lot.
13. Europe trip.
