# Looking Back

I have liked to track the things since I was a child, mentally I used to revisit the previous month and assess whether I had been productive or what kind of events had happened. Usually in those years, time relatively felt passing slowly instead of real fast. I can't actually grasp how fast time is passing by, a year literally feels like nothing. I do not have an idea to why the time is passing by so fast, interesting things do happen now and then but usually mostly the routine is repetitive. 

I would say that due to being busy mostly or indulging in activities time tends to go really fast, but again it's just scary that it's 2023 now, 2016 just feels like yesterday.
