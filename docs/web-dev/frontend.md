# Front end

I use **ReactJS** mainly as my choice of frontend web development. I have tried **Vue** as well but due to React being used mainly in industry I just decided to stick with it. Currently, I am using ReactJS alongside Material UI on my internship as well.

## What I like about frontend

I love Frontend development a lot as it allows me to be creative and try different things. I do am scared of CSS a lot because it can take a long time to set things right and I am not too proficient in it. 

For now frontend development is my goto software area and I surely love it a lot. I do have learnt backend too but it was not as much enjoyable as frontend for me.
