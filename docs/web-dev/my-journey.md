# My journey 
This is a personal momento which may be used as a roadmap for some newbies, although there are many other great sources and roadmaps available throughout internet which can provide a better understanding of and a better way to follow. This is an example: Roadmap

## ðŸ’» Frontend (initial steps):
I first touched HTML in 7th grade but not having enough source/motivation to learn I dropped it. After having an introductory course to web development in 2nd semester of my Computer Engineering I got into loving it. In short span of time (was quite stressful) I learnt HTML, CSS and Javascript. These three things are the main startup and standard for any Web Developer. HTML is backbone of all the internet and whichever stack you use you will always have to use HTML. Even if you decide to go into backend HTML becomes kind of a need. CSS goes along with this and Javascript is the big deal. JS slowly started as to make the web dynamic but has steadily taken over every component of web development. It now dominates the front end of the web development with many frameworks and now is being used in the backend in form of NodeJS.

After having an idea of HTML,CSS and JS it is important to build some designs in order to get your hands on all of them. Practising them is really important. What I regret is that I have never made many designs and websites due to being cramped by university courses and what not. This may lead to bad front end skills so excluding this can be very dangerous. I plan on practice my front end skills a lot more especially after this semester (jeez i am taking 12 courses).

## ðŸ’» Frontend (advanced steps):
As of 2022 React is dominating the market. If you are deep into the web dev you might have heard of these frameworks which are used on Client Side for CSR(Client Side Rendering). If you have no idea what is CSR I suggest reading upon this. When I first started learning VueJS I never had an idea why I was learning it. I just heard of this framework and dove right into it. When I started learning some basic NodeJS it was then that I learnt why are these frameworks used. It lead me into deep understanding of web development and how things on the web work.

Frontend frameworks make lives of all the people invovled easier. Once a website gets larger (think of Amazon) we can no longer maintain thousands of lines of HTML or PHP (in case of ECommerce) code so we need an optimal solution and a more structed way to build things. This is where the king of web development Javascript jumps in. It simply divides web development into more structed way of programming having all those best practises and what not to make all the angry grannies happy. These are dozen of frameworks in market and one of the downside of markets is that it keeps changing. Google introduced Angular and as of 2021 Angular support will be pulled of by Google, once there was Ember JS and many other frameworks which are dead. Heck even React has a better version named NextJS which solves the problem of SEO faced in React. Nonetheless before diving in which framework to learn I suggest you to learn why are they used and which one is trending. There are plently of sources to learn these , it depends on the person but I find Udemy to be quite good in this regard.

## ðŸ“Š Backend:
I have not learnt much backend so this part is empty now I will write it once I have some experience in backend programming. As of now I was learning NodeJS with MongoDB and ExpressJS but due to university I have had to leave that. I have taken some notes of what I have learnt in Backend Developement

## ðŸ“‡ A friendly advice:
I have not yet implemented this but sticking to one domain is like putting all your eggs in one basket which in my opinion is not applicable at all. It is better to have a bit of experience is some departments and then intermix those skills. I am not saying here to be jack of all trades and master of none but being master of all and also being a jack of some trades. While this may seem kind of unrealistic but if you are really dedicated to become the best in your field you may always find a way to learn new things. Recently I am trying to implement my Cyber Security skills in finding exploitations in the websites I try to design. Recently after learning SQL and PHP I tried to SQL Inject a simple website therefore giving me quite a joy as I intermixed both of the things I had learnt.
