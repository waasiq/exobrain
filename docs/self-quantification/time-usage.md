# Time Usage

## Preface
After high school my screen time went exponentially up, coupled up with pandemic there were mostly days I would just use the screen whole day long. My eyesight has recently weaked up but I don't think computer credits to it, I would say its mostly genetic factor.

## Methods used
I use a combination of methods to measure my time usage. I use ActivityWatch to measure the time I spend on my computer alongside Crystal Disk Info. I use wakatime to measure the time I spend on coding. Although for mobile I haven't used anything to measure the time I spend on it. As for the future, I will research more on how to measure the time I spend on my phone and other activities. 
I find this concept really cool, imagine if after dying we were given the summary on things which we spent our time on. The money we spent on various things, or the amount of breaths we took etc.
Sadly such things aren't possible maybe someday in the future we might get such technology.

### Screen Hours: 
Though the method I use might not be the best, I use crystal disk info to see the SSD or HDD hours on them. The thing with this method is I do not know how much idle time I have on my computer. Furthermore, I have not measured the time I use on social media, youtube or other sources but I do think that it might be a lot. 
1. HP 15 BS015. HDD Hours: 5187
2. ASUS TUF A15 FA506IV: 6500
3. ASUS ROG Stix: 589 

**Total:12276** 

    Average usage of screen on a day: 10 hours
    Using average since 2018-Present: 10*365*5 = 18250 hours
    Almost 40 percent of time after high school is spent on screen
