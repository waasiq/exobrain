# Seasons
I actually like seasons more than list due to the story being fascinating and the ability to relate a lot more with characters due to the slow character development. 
Although I haven't watched much seasons I plan to watch some of the famous ones as the time passes on.

2. Prison Break
3. House MD
4. Monk

7. BoJack Horseman

## Wishlist
