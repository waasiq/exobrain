# Movies

I used to watch a lot of movies in my teenage years on television and during my time at CCH we had movie night every Saturday which was very good but after 2018 I stopped watching a lot of movies. Now I rarely watch a movie unless I am with someone. Usually sometimes me and my friend Bedru go to cinema to enjoy a movie and time out from our busy lives. Still I made a list of the movies I have watched and I will try to keep it updated as I watch more movies.
