# Self Quantification

## Introduction
I discovered the concept of self quantification around 2020. Initially I started using notes.txt and saving them to Github repository. After discovering digital gardens I started to read more about them. I tried using Wordpress blog but it was just not what I wanted, so this website serves both the purpose of a digital garden and a blog. 

I like maths and stats a lot, although I am not obsessed in tracking my sleep or weight or things like but I like to track the amount of time I have spent doing different things. I do plan on to track things about my health as time passes on and log in different things about my body but after I have logged in things that have happened with in my life. 

## What to expect in this section?
Different things I have done over time some might be silly but some might be useful. I will try to keep this section updated as I do more things.

## Why I track things
Just something I enjoy and find intriguing. 

## What I track
For now I track the places I have visited, games I have played, things I know, a wishlist of different things. I also track the amount of time I have spent doing different things. 

## Tools I use for Screen Time
I use <a href="https://wakatime.com/" >WakaTime</a> with VSCode for tracking the time I code everyweek. For some other tasks I use <a href="https://activitywatch.net/" >ActivityWatch</a> to track my activity time. 

For games ofcourse steam games log the steam hours, and see my playtime after playing a game.
