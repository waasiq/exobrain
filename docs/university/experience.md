My university experience has not been one of the best because of two reasons:
i) Corona Virus Pandemic made all education go online for 3 semesters and it was not very effective and productive for me.
ii) I was not able to go to the university because of the pandemic and I was not able to make any friends or meet new people.
iii) After that I went for semester abroad which was the only thing I will remember about my university experience.

Being a foreign student in Turkey has its ups and downs, to be real honest I couldn't socialize enough with my peers and due to the language being different a lot of times it became hard for me to communicate although my proficiency in language was high. Most of the students in Computer Engineering in my department are anti-social so another downside of it. I didn't like the system of the public universities in Turkey either, for example not having access to past papers was a huge bummer for me. 

There was another aspect for me too, in back of my mind I knew most of the things I will learn might not even help in my career as I had decided very early on to go into Software field. I knew there are actually better sources on the internet which could teach and help me learn way way better than the teachers in my university, so I was not very motivated to learn.

I am not quite satisfied with the academic side of my university life, I caught up to socializing and made friends, for my skills I worked hard to learn different things, I don't regret too much about my university life now and I think given the choice again I might have chosen the same path. 

One thing is for sure, university provided me a platform to grow and I utilized that platform well , I might have done some of the things in a better way but I think I have a very perfectionist approach to life and it is okay to make mistakes and learn from them. It is also good to accept your natural limits and set yourself personal goals instead of comparative goals which lead to misery.
