In my last year of highschool I started looking into foreign university admissions as I wanted to study abroad in order to experience new culture, travel around and meet different people. A lot of inspiration were my seniors who went abroad and lot of them helped me a lot especially I remember Huzefah bhai helping me a lot with applications. I was also roomates with the A level guys who were also applying abroad, so all this amounted into a decision to try to get an admission in a foreign university.

My main goal was USA on a financial aid, for that I started preparing for SAT and was busy with essays and Common App applications, my last year in highschool was one of the most hardest year of my life as I was quite sick and had to manage between studies, foreign applications and college competitions. Amazingly somehow I pulled it through all it but I couldn't score good on SAT and got rejected from almost all the universities in USA, in January 2018 I had applied for Turkey Burslari scholarship because one of my friends and senior applied for it, honestly I just wanted to get over the applications so I tried to just apply and forget about it.

I even remember that I didn't research the universities really good and just selected them in a similar order to my friend, frankly I was not expecting the response to be positive after getting all the rejections from US colleges. I had made up my mind to study in Pakistani universities and kind of given up on the dream to study abroad but it is usually when you do not expect something, something pops up.
