## A Trip Down Memory Lane
Video games have been my love since childhood. The earliest memory I have is of my dad playing miniclip games in 2006. I first played video games in 2007 in my cousins home, I remember playing CS 1.6 and Dangerous Dave with my uncle and cousins. 

At that time, even though I was 7 years old video games provided me different kind of facisination which nothing did. One of the earliest memories I have is to play Bugs Life with my friend in evening after school, I still remember how fun it was back then to just stress about the next level only. Recently I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9ErBdfSgA0&ab_channel=FirstPlaysHD"> gameplay</a> of the game and it brought back so many memories. 

I played a lot of web games back in 2010 especially Farm ville and city ville on Facebook. It used to be a lot of fun to make your own city in a simulator or look after your farm, sadly though my crops used to overgrow a lot as we had not a good internet back then. 

In 2011 I started playing 8 Pool and miniclip games and also tried GTA: SA on my computer but sadly the RAM back then was too low to run even simplest of games. Although I do remember playing NFS: Underground and being really happy to play such a game. 

In 2012 and 2013 I was playing Shadow Gun: Deadzone and other games on my android tablet. I also finished GTA: SA and GTA: 3 on that tablet. Later on in 2014 I started playing CoD: MW3 multiplayer on laptop. I still remember running MW3 on my laptop with 2GB RAM and Intel HD 3000 graphics, although it was laggy and not very smooth but it was still fun to play. I still have a lot of good memories from playing MW3. 

Sadly MW3 became a bit boring around 2015 start as most of my friends stopped playing it or started playing other games so I transitioned towards DOTA 2 in mid 2015. At first, I didn't understand much anything in DOTA 2 but slowly slowly I started to learn it and it seemed quite fun to play it. 

In mid 2016 till mid 2018 I took a break from gaming as I joined a boarding school for my 11th and 12th grade. I did play a bit of DOTA 2 but not much. In 2019 I kept playing DOTA 2 and tried some single player titles on my laptop but stopped playing later on. 

In 2021 Jan - 2021 June I played a lot of games. For the most part of my day I was just played video games due to two reasons: the education was online and I couldn't focus or learn anything due to COVID. The other reason was I was not mentally healthy thus it just lead to misery and overthinking for me and as a coping mechanism I played video games all day long. On the plus side I did play a lot of games which I had never played and made some real good memories of them. Having the feeling of getting a laptop which can run almost every game on high settings was a great feeling. 

After 2021 June I started to focus on my studies and I have been doing that since then. I have been playing games but not as much as I used to. In 2022 summers I played a lot of single player games alongside some DOTA too. Since September 2022 I have stopped playing games for some while as I am currently working on my job and doing some side projects like this one.

Never imagined that I would write so much about video games, but I guess it was fun to write about it. :)
