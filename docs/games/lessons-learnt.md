Gaming gave me a lot of good memories but one of the things I realized is that I started to lean on gaming as a coping mechanism and for escapism. In one way it was good that I had found a coping mechanism but what was really devastating about this was that my coping mechanism is categorized under addictive category and escapism is not a solution to the problems. 

Although I do credit gaming for helping me pass through hard times especially when there was no one to talk to gaming provided me a mental cushion to fall on and feel better. I think this is also one of the reason gaming industry is heavily male dominated and most of the gamers I know use it to cope. (Just my 2 cents I might be wrong or might not have enough experience).

I never plan to stop gaming and plan to continue for longtime as I still enjoy playing new games everytime along with logging about it. I just hope that I don't fall into the trap of gaming addiction again and I can use it as a tool to relax and not as a coping mechanism.
