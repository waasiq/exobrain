Man, I just don't even know how to describe DOTA 2 in this blog. DOTA is something just too beautiful yet too ugly at the same time, too complex yet too simple at the same time, too enjoyable (when you are winning) yet too depressive at the same time.

I think I can safely say DOTA is my favourite game of all time. It is one the game I wanted to get professional at and wanted to play ESports in but some dreams stay dreams. 

I play as pos 1 or 2, on a given day I would prefer 1 if I want to win a game else I would prefer mid as it is more fun and you can rotate early game in order to make plays. Mid has more action instead of AFK farming so I prefer it for the fun. 

DotA has a very steep learning curve and it is certainly a game which is extremely complex for starters. I have 2K hours in it and I still learnt some thing recently.
Although, it does get toxic once you get in the grind mindset a lot. In my case I just start flaming if I think the other person is not doing a lot, the reason for it is that even if you play your game perfectly if one of the main core messes his game then its very hard to comeback and win the game. 

I would not say that I will play DOTA too much just to have fun because something it just gets toxic and after a lot of playing it does get boring, but that is on me because I tend to overplay DOTA a lot.
