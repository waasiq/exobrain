# Travel

Travelling around the world is a passion I developed after seeing my father 
travel around when I was 10 years old. I have an intriguing personality and I have always been a lot curious to see what there is around the world. One of the reasons I applied abroad to study was to travel around the world and experience a different culture and lifestyle. I have travelled to 14 countries, met lots of different people, tried different foods and saw new perspectives of different people. 

I am quite thankful to God for having such an oppurtunity because coming from a third world country there is no way I could have even imagined to travel this much at this age. It was something I dreamnt of since long and one of the reasons I put myself out in places I had never been before. 

Travel is something which opens your mind to new things in life, some people argue that travel might change their perspective on life and I do agree with this but it might be because you have enough time to think about different things as you are away from all the stress of work and life when you are back home.

I have a lot of travelling stories I will share in this section, I started maintaining my travel blog during Erasmus+ semester and soon I will be porting it to the blog section of this website.
