# Travel

Travelling around the world is a passion I developed after seeing my father 
travel around when I was 10 years old. I have an intriguing personality and I have always been a lot curious to see what there is around the world. One of the reasons I applied abroad to study was to travel around the world and experience a different culture and lifestyle. I have travelled to 14 countries, met lots of different people, tried different foods and saw new perspectives of different people. 

I am quite thankful to God for having such an oppurtunity because coming from a third world country there is no way I could have imagined to travel this much at this age. It was something I dreamnt of since long and one of the reasons I put myself out in places I had never been.
