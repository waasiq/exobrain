# Cyber Security 

Cyber security consists of several fields like any other coding field we know of. The complexities in it a bit on the high end of learning curve but yet again it is doable by everyone provided they are willing to put in the hard work. In order to dive into cyber security one must start on small scale by learning basic Linux. One of the best sources to start hand one with Linux CMD would be to solve problems given on this website : <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/"> Bandit</a>
These problems are Aimed at beginners starting to learn Linux CMD . Do note that usage of Linux CMD is must and it takes a lot of practice to get used to. Linux relies heavily on its cmd unlike GUI usage of windows.

One can also fire up Kali Linux on VMWare or Virtual Box and start to fidget around with the immense tools it contains. One of the tools I liked was MFSVenom used to create payloads. Again this field may sound intimidating but in the end its all 1's and 0's on a very basic level. One of the courses which I took back in 2019 really stuck with me I would recommend this if you were to try some things out.

Once you get to get a basic grip on things you would realize that this field requires hand on practice on problems and things. No matter how much you read unless you don't practice it will all go to waste. People interested in Cyber Security practice on problems often called Capture The Flag (CTF). Basically you need to solve the problem and then you get a flag which is the answer.

Starting on  CTF might seem intimidating but it is really helpful. A good source which explains quite good: [Link](https://dev.to/atan/what-is-ctf-and-how-to-get-started-3f04)

I'll keep updating regarding any other good sources I find regarding Cyber Security and no you can't hack Facebook unless you have physical access to device or tap into the wifi (Man in the Middle Attack) even then most of the data is encrypted :).
