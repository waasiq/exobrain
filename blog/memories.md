# Memories! 

<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
Revising my C++ code while taking a mug of coffee at night 2AM with all the silence around me is the perfect night for coding.
After all , its Friday no classes tomorrow and I can stay awake as long as I like. My yellow lamp shines beside the computer , illuminating up 
the physics notes that lay on my table. Looking at all the numbers and equations some questions start to coming to my mind: 
Have you ever wondered that after you reach a specific age, when you are awaiting the angel of death to come and take you , how would you feel? 
What would you think at that moment? Would you be fulfilled with your life or be filled with regrets? These questions sometime takes to my mind
absorbing me into endless thoughts. Thinking whether would I remember the lines of code I wrote or the hours I worked ? 
<br /><br />
I pull my chair thinking how would I modify the input class for the Bank Accounting System that I am making for my Github. The memories of 
the past adventure when I went to Pammukale come into my mind fulfilling with me some joyful moments of my adventure. The strangers I met
and talked to. 5 years backwards: I am sitting in home, playing Call of Duty studying and enjoying football games. These small memories give
me burst of joy and I start to think of simpler times without any stress. The above asked questions suddenly start to come into my 
mind once again out of nowhere. Would I remember these nights I worked hard , the hours of video games I played or the people I had fun 
with? I sit blankly looking onto notepad to understand what to write but my mind is blank. The answer that my mind answers is simple : Memories.

I think of memories as short instances we remember since childhood, have you ever sat alone and thought what you remembered from the 
ages 1-5? Chances are there might be 1 thing at least you are able to recall from that age group. Even as you grow up you don't tend up to forget 
these memories, as they are kind of permanent with you. We are just instances of memories woven in the delicate space of time which unites over
the face that our instances have somehow union over them. Breaking a single piece of union incompletes the sacered yarn. In broader terms the 
million instances just vanish leaving the ghost of instances behind, nothing more to cherish nothing less to cherish.
