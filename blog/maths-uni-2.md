# Maths in Universe II 

<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
Just one afternoon I was reading about XX and XY chromosomes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_chromosome#Inheritance_pattern" >this</a> interesting part of Wikipedia caught my attention. X chromosome as you may have read is one of the gender determining chromosome in mammals but what is unique that this chromosome forms has an inheritance pattern in humans. Females are identified by the XX chromosome while the males have the XY chromosome.

As mentioned on the Wikipedia site the  X chromosome inheritance line at a given ancestral generation follows the Fibonacci sequence.

Lets consider a person X. If traced back up towards GGGGG-grandparents a person has 128 ancestors.  Of these 128 ancestors, a male will have 21 people who potentially contributed to their single X chromosome (8 males and 13 females).  A female will have 34 potential contributors to her two X chromosomes (13 males and 21 females).  These are potential contributors because it is unlikely that all these ancestors are equally represented in the X chromosome – it is more likely that some ancestors are completely missing while others are well-represented.
