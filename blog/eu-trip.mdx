# West Europe Trip

<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
I'll be leaving for a Europe trip on 15th, going to Stockholm, Sweden from Warsaw, Poland. I am travelling solo over a span of 3 weeks covering 9 countries and 12 cities. 

I am trying Couchsurfing in several cities, fingers crossed for everything. I'll be posting about my trips whenever. Right now, I feel a bit scared, excited and liberated about this trip. Afterall going alone is a bit scary and also coupled with couch surfing its a huge risk but after all what  is life without a little bit risk?
