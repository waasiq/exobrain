# Do we/I matter?
<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
A year ago I was quite in a chaotic place in my mind, the uncertainty of the future made me anxious and alongside the dystopia of online education made me worried too. I moved back to Turkey in December is quite a bad shape, I was quite alone and stressed over so many things. I had no one to talk to and staying home for a long while made me homesick too.

After moving to Dorm, I was quite surprised to find that in a place of 6 people I was staying alone and the reason was obvious: everybody was back at home due to the pandemic. I remember playing video games all day long and after a while I got bored of them so I usually started to take long walks near my dorm. Sakarya is a student city so when everyone is back at home it's quite empty and a great place to think about things and ponder over a plethora of topics. I was facing a lot of uncertainty at that phase of my life and had lost a sense of meaning in my life, this opened me up to a very nihilist behavior and slowly I started to ask myself a very dangerous question: Does anything matter? Followed by this were the specific questions regarding myself and things around me: Do I matter? Does my struggle matter?

I tried to give myself any reason to why anything can matter for me but my mind could not find reasonable logic. If we look into the history of humanity there have been innumerable people who have made advancements to the history of humanity but not have been remembered and even those who are well documented are not recognized by the common people today. I am pretty sure that most of the people won't even remember the 25th president of the USA although he might have had made something that contributed to the country and that is ofcourse not a intrisically bad thing. 

The point here being is that even if we contribute greatly to humanity (one of the biggest achievements one can do in his lifetime) eventually we all will be forgotten. According to science humanity has been here for more than 6 million years and several hundred generations have passed before us. If one starts to think of it the way which I described a logical deduction that can be made from this is we don't really matter that much and an even more scary realization is that people close to us slowly and steadily move on and forget us provided we drop dead today. Yes, it is absolutely fine and natural to move on and in my opinion its the most healthy path to take too as clinging onto past or something that you can't get is absolutely drastic. 

When I started to think of things in such a context I became a lot depressed and thought to myself nothing that I am doing in my life would eventually matter so why even try? 

For me the solace to this question was only in the fact that I accepted the fact that most of things I do today or I achieved do not matter for anyone, in short nobody cares. Somehow facing this truth set me free like a bird from a cage, I started to enjoy life on my own without a worry. I found solace in the fact that I matter for myself and when I look back at my life I will be satisfied with what I done and achieved in life. Yes, even if I am perished from the face of Earth in several years most people might not remember me (I haven't done anything quite exceptional in order to have them remember me). 

So the answer to the question for me was: Yes I do matter at least for myself. I do not know how much I matter for other people but I have to enjoy life on my own. I have to do things I love for myself and treat myself to the best of things which are possible. I heard the following quote in BoJack horseman and it has quite stuck with me, I think it fits quite good here:

"In the great grand scheme of things, we're just tiny specks that will one day be forgotten. So, it doesn't matter what we did in the past, or how we'll be remembered. The only thing that matters is right now, this moment, this one spectacular moment we are sharing."
