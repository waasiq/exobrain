Apart from the boring axiomatics mathematics, algebra, geometry, and combinatorics we were taught in high school, an interesting notion of mathematics in universe has not been discussed much. Agreed that using unitary method or interest rate does help us in calculating how much money we owe to the government for the amount of the breaths we take but if we start to analyze things around us mathematically an interesting notion sometimes comes to the mind , is the universe made of mathematics? 

Max Tegmark a Swedish - American physicist first proposed the mathematical universe hypothesis (MUH). The theory describes Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure which translate the physical universe is not merely described by mathematics, but is mathematics. The theory can easily be countered by physicists by describing the immense physics of the universe or in also  by the proof of quarks at the quantum level but the theory does take a interesting take on things mathematically. I usually look things from a computing perspective, for example whenever to go a specific path implementing Dijkstra's algorithm seems like the best choice in my mind  but again if we look into most of the concepts of computer science they contain a lot of mathematics on their core. Yet again if we try to study computer science or even universe without physics or chemistry things tend to go take a pretty bad turn, I cannot explain the circuity without physics or the rotating of Earth using just mathematics, yes the mathematical part of all that helps us but without the physical concept we cannot comprehend the part. 

An interesting notion that I have noticed in human interactions, nature, human psychology, weather et cetera is that somehow somewhat these contain a specific pattern following a mathematical structure. Weather patterns seems to recur every year, interhuman interactions seem to form in childhood and tend to continue a pattern throughout life unless changed by the person. Agreed that a lot of factors contribute to all of the things mentioned above, also if we consider pseudo randomness of mathematics my argument literally becomes irrelevant. Recently I discovered something which blew my mind and since then I have started to read regarding mathematical logics of universe.
