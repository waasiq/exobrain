# Day 2 of Stockholm

<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
Next day similarly I woke up early and went around Gamla Stan, there was this amazing photo point which Dale suggested me to go so I took a bus to that point. It was actually 7:30 when I reached there and nobody was there at all. I really wanted to go to the washroom but all the shops were closed so somehow I saw a cathedral nearby and releived myself. xD 

It's one of the most funny story I have of Stockholm, after exiting the Cathedral I actually found some people to take a photo of me. There was this elderly couple I had small talk with, they were actually quite nice to me. After this I went to other photo point and actually had to wait a lot for someone to come to take a photo of me. Finally, a French student showed up and took a picture of me which was quite nice. After going around that area for a bit, I went to the bus stop and took a bus to the city center. I wanted to explore the Eastern part of Gamla Stan so I just started to go here and there, there was this peculiar shop I noticed and went inside.

The shopkeeper was selling maps and most interestingly older maps, I was quite intrigued by this and I had quite a talk with him. He discovered the passion of collecting map when he bought a map for his nephew, after that he left his job of teaching English and moved to Sweden and started collecting maps. His job was to collect maps and sell them and he was actually making good money out of it. This shows that if you love something provided if your circumstances provide it, sometimes it might be more beneficial to follow your passion. 

After exiting the shop I started going towards Vasa muesuem, and boarded the ship which goes there. After reaching Skansen, an Island which contains most of the muesuem of Stockholm. I just walked around that Island and was truly amazed by how amazing it was, the Nordiska muesuem building was actually one of the most amazing building I have ever seen in my life. 

After that I went inside Vasa muesuem, I really like that muesuem. Quite a fascinating story of it, I spent some time there. I hadn't seen old boats before this so it was something which was unique to me. After that I went back to Kings square to watch some ice skating, initially I planned on to skate but there were a lot of people and I felt anxious. I think holding someone and doing with someone who is experienced is better approach, maybe some day I will finally ice skate. 

After this I moved back to Dale's apartment, my bus was in the morning so I packed some of my stuff and had some talk with Dale too. He was actually impressed by how much I had seen, we had dinner and after that I went to sleep.
