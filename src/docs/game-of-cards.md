# A Game of Cards

<p  style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
I breathe heavily as I look onto my cards, an Ace and a two. Yesterday I gambled all my money so I have the last chips on this gamble. “Baby, what you are going to do?“ I turn around in surprise to find nobody, maybe it's my mind speaking to itself. The remnants of her still burn so hard that I can’t forget the fire within. I hope she is okay in the arms of someone else while I am gambling for my life. “Pass!” exclaims the man on my right. “Deal” the dealer exclaims and throws a card; it’s a seven of the club. Another bullshit luck what to do: It’s my turn, I am sweating hard either this is it or else I have to sleep another night on the park bench.

“Afferdersiniz Burada boş mu?” (Excuse me, is it empty here?) a man exclaims as I come on to my senses from my sleep. These dreams never stop for me I exclaim to myself while checking my mobile, 0 messages just like my life. "Nobody cares for you buddy get used to it", my right hemisphere of the brain is starting another round of repression against the left hemisphere. I watch the rain outside and wonder of the days crying in washroom because I couldn’t go to the Trip to Turkey because it was too expensive. It reminds me of the relationship with family and I don’t want to remember all that because somehow some part of me is moving on. What is life? The damn brain exclaims another question, these questions never stop coming to me. I think onto my dream: why did I dream of a card game? I have never gambled my life let alone I hate cards unless it’s a magic trick. A realization of things start on me like always: the dealer symbolized God, the cards symbolized my life and as I was the player playing with the cards the dealer gave me: I didn’t pick them but what I could do is play with those cards efficiently. The other players symbolize those who are those with me in the game but they may pass and leave the game for other players to join. The dealer may deal bad cards and some good cards but the only thing I have to do is play the game efficiently. Mind you! Not to win it but to enjoy it. After all, games are made to enjoy and the enjoyment part is what we remember later on to cherish not the matches we won but the fun we had. Think of your life as such, the things you are cursing today might be your body, your intelligence or your situation are all the cards dealt by the dealer, what you can do is to make the best use of them in order to win and enjoy the game together. That’s what holds true for the philosophy right now in my life. God knows what cards I may be dealt with later on in life.
