# Emptiness

<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
I sit on my computer as I look outside the window, dry and a cold windy evening with no sun to brighten up the mood. I take a sip of warm tea beside me as I start to code the next part of my project. I can't focus on the thing on hand as my mind is always wandering to some other place. Even after reading lots of articles and trying a lot of self discovery techniques I still can't figure out this empty feeling inside me. 

Is it due to not being close to anyone or due to feeling abandoned in adolescence? Or it is due to not being cared enough for or being lonely most of the time? Or is it simply because I haven't found someone while all the people around me are in relationships and some of them are even getting married? I can speak in 5 languages, code in almost 4 languages, recite Game theory on back of my hand, prove a Pythagoras theorem but answering this question has always posed me such a big challenge.

Humans yearn attachment and the feel to be attached to some purpose, group or someone is something that is encoded in human nature. This very biological cell coding is the reason why mothers care for children or why people want to be together, it is something that has been since the start of humanity. To be honest, the concept is quite simple a human needs to be attached to something because we are programmed to find meaning in everything. Life without a meaning or purpose leads us to dangerous places questioning our beliefs, being nihilistic and having depression. Yes there can be a counter argument to what I just said but in my experience one needs to have at least some kind of personal belief or an attachment towards something because without that the mind often tends to go towards self destructive paths. 

Since I was 15 years there has had been a hollow feel to be loved. As I entered university this feeling kept intensifying and even today I still do have this kind of empty feeling inside me and the need to be loved and love. I try to fill up my life with work, video games, learning and adventure but somehow this feeling is always there, somewhere hidden deep inside my heart - eating me slowly and steadily. Loneliness has  and the thought that no one cares has also contributed a lot to this feeling. I know professional therapy works but being a student therapy comes as quite expensive, healing oneself and sorting all these problems also are quite hard alone. From the previous year I had been quite hopeless and recently I have had a bit of hope for me, I liked someone and got a bit brave and told her about my feeling, sadly another rejection in life. I know things will get better but being hopeful seems quite hard for me after all this battle I have endured, maybe one day there will be someone who will radiate a similar joyous energy as me and understand me. Until then I have to someone keep fighting with this emptiness inside with all the distractions I can find.
