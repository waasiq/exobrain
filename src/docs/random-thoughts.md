# Random Thoughts
<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
I am one of those generation which grew confused up what to do? Being in Pakistan, a third world country, I was always looking for answers but having 
parents from educated background made me fulfill my hunger for knowledge. I am one of the generation which grew listening to Eminem to cure my depression, 
this might seem relatable to many but rap helped me in one of the hardest days of life. Still when I hear his word combination, swearing I admire that guy
who tried suicide three times in his life. I remember the first time in 2011 I heard "Not Afraid" and I was like on the top of world and even 8 years
after I am still amazed by that song. Once I remember I was watering my grandma's grave and my father was beside me, I still vividly remember that moment as 
if it just happened three minutes ago, he saw the two scars on my left hand and said "You will be very rich one day". Years later this thing clicked 
in my mind working in my dorm room on my Turkish and programming and absorbed my inside the memory. I don't know how or when but I do know that the
last power remaining in my body will be working towards it, not because money attracts me but because I love the journey of the hardwork. I love 
working so hard that I am near mental and body exhausation, people often my roomates have several times told me of my hardwork. I don't care anymore
about anyone, I don't care if people like my photograph on social media, if the girl in my class looks at me or not, just one thing - my goal. My goal , 
family , close friends is now only I care about. Fuck my past , fuck that bitch which dumped me, fuck everything that anyone even as close to me did to me, 
I don't fucking care about any of that.

# HSP
<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
One of the earliest memories of the childhood in Okara I have is me
crying in front of the TV because the baby of the mother in TV cried.
I just realized after years now that the memory is stored in a corner in 
some part of my brain that reactivated after a while. It was another 
sign on me being HSP while was not realized by my parents which eventually 
led me to spend a much harder life by self teaching and self healing. Things 
added on other by me leaving home at small age.

# Pain
<p style = {{textAlign:"justify"}}>
I don't know what to say coping up is becoming harder day by day. There is so much pain,void and depression inside me which I want to 
fix. I don't know what will happen, suicidal thoughts have become more frequent. I thought things would get better when I was in 9th. Then 
in CCH I thought things would be great once I am in a good uni. Now in university on a scholarship I am still not happy.
